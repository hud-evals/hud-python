And compare year over year? \n\nIf margins were getting squeezed while throughput volumes were consistent, figure out what drove that - is it because crude differentials were tightening up, or could it be related to how they timed their maintenance schedules? And based on the findings at that time, what would have been implied about their optimization approach heading into Q2 2024?",
