Web tools let agents browse the internet and search for information. Two types: client-executed (your environment runs the browser) and hosted (provider runs the search).

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Execution | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `PlaywrightTool` | Client | Full browser automation |
| `WebSearchTool` | Hosted (Claude) | Real-time web search |
| `GoogleSearchTool` | Hosted (Gemini) | Google search |
| `WebFetchTool` | Client | Fetch page content |

## PlaywrightTool

Full browser automation via Playwright. Navigate, click, type, screenshot.

```python
from hud.tools import PlaywrightTool

browser = PlaywrightTool()

# Or connect to existing browser
browser = PlaywrightTool(cdp_url="http://localhost:9222")
```

**Actions**: `navigate`, `screenshot`, `click`, `type`, `get_page_info`, `wait_for_element`

```python
# Navigate
await browser(action="navigate", url="https://example.com", wait_for_load_state="networkidle")

# Screenshot
result = await browser(action="screenshot")
# Returns ContentResult with base64_image

# Click element
await browser(action="click", selector="button.submit")

# Type in input
await browser(action="type", selector="input#search", text="HUD AI")

# Wait for element
await browser(action="wait_for_element", selector=".results")

# Get page info
info = await browser(action="get_page_info")
# Returns: {"url": "...", "title": "..."}
```

**Load states**: `commit`, `domcontentloaded`, `load`, `networkidle`

When done:

```python
await browser.close()
```

## WebSearchTool (Claude)

Claude's native web search. Executed server-side by Anthropic. Results appear in the response with citations.

```python
from hud.tools.hosted import WebSearchTool

search = WebSearchTool(
    max_uses=10,                        # Max searches per request
    allowed_domains=["docs.python.org"],# Only these domains
    blocked_domains=["spam.com"],       # Never these domains
)
```

Uses `web_search_20250305` API. $10 per 1,000 searches.

<Note>
Hosted tools are declared in your environment but executed by the provider. You don't call them directly—Claude invokes them and results appear in the response.
</Note>

## GoogleSearchTool (Gemini)

Google Search for Gemini. Also hosted—executed by Google.

```python
from hud.tools.hosted import GoogleSearchTool

search = GoogleSearchTool()
```

## WebFetchTool

Fetch and extract content from URLs.

```python
from hud.tools.hosted import WebFetchTool

fetch = WebFetchTool()
result = await fetch(url="https://example.com/article")
```

## Hosted vs Client

**Hosted tools** (WebSearchTool, GoogleSearchTool):
- You declare them, provider executes them
- Results in response metadata
- No local browser needed

**Client tools** (PlaywrightTool, WebFetchTool):
- Your environment runs the browser
- Full control over interaction
- Screenshots, clicks, form filling

## Typical Setup

```python
from hud import Environment
from hud.tools import PlaywrightTool
from hud.tools.hosted import WebSearchTool

env = Environment("web-env")
env.add_tool(PlaywrightTool())
env.add_tool(WebSearchTool())
```

## CDP for Containers

In Docker, run Chrome with remote debugging and connect via CDP:

```python
# Chrome running with: --remote-debugging-port=9222
browser = PlaywrightTool(cdp_url="http://localhost:9222")
```

## Customizing

Log all browser actions with hooks:

```python
from hud.tools import PlaywrightTool

browser = PlaywrightTool()

@browser.after
async def log_action(action: str = "", result=None, **kwargs):
    print(f"Browser: {action}")

env.add_tool(browser)
```

Or subclass for deeper control:

```python
from typing import Any
from hud.tools import PlaywrightTool

class TrackedBrowserTool(PlaywrightTool):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.history: list[str] = []
    
    async def navigate(self, url: str, **kwargs: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
        self.history.append(url)
        return await super().navigate(url, **kwargs)
```
