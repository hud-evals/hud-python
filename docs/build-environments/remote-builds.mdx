The HUD platform can build your environments in the cloud directly from your GitHub repositories with a few simple steps.

## Connect GitHub

First, connect your GitHub account to HUD by installing the GitHub App.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the New Environment Page">
  Click **New** in the top right header of the HUD platform and click **Environment** to go to the [New Environment Page](https://hud.ai/environments/new).
</Step>

<Step title="Install the GitHub App">
  Click **Connect GitHub** to install the HUD GitHub App. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the installation.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose Repository Access">
  Select which repositories HUD can access:

  - **All repositories** - HUD can build from any repo in your account
  - **Only select repositories** - Grant access to specific repos

  <Note>
  You can change repository access later in your GitHub settings.
  </Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Build an Environment

Once GitHub is connected, you can build environments from your repositories.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a Repository">
  Back on the HUD platform, choose a repository from the list and click **Import**. Only repositories you've granted access to will appear.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose a Branch (Optional)">
  Select a branch to build from. Defaults to `main` or the repository's default branch if not specified.
</Step>

<Step title="Start the Build">
  Click **Build Environment** to start the remote build process. HUD will:

  1. Clone your repository
  2. Build the Docker image using your Dockerfile
  3. Push the image to the HUD registry
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Build Progress">
  Watch the build logs in real-time. Build times vary depending on your Dockerfile complexity and dependencies.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Test Your Environment

After a successful build, test your environment by creating a task.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a New Task">
  Click **New** in the top right header again, then click **Task**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Your Environment">
  In the Task pane on the left, find and select your newly built environment.

</Step>

<Step title="Start Testing">
  Connect to the environment and interact with it to verify it works as expected.
</Step>

<Step title="Run a Task">
  Once you're ready, write a prompt, select at least an evaluate tool, and run the task with your new environment.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Rebuild on Changes

HUD automatically rebuilds your environment when you push changes to GitHub. Rebuilds are triggered on the branch you selected for your latest build.

To manually trigger a rebuild:

1. Navigate to your environment [on the HUD platform](https://hud.ai/environments)
2. Click **Rebuild** in the Builds tab to pull the latest code and build a new image

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Repository not appearing | Check that you've granted HUD access in GitHub settings |
| Build fails immediately | Verify your Dockerfile exists in the repository root or look for errors in the build logs |
| Build fails with a Docker Hub rate limit error | Securely save your [Docker Hub credentials in your settings](https://www.hud.ai/project/secrets) to avoid hitting the unauthenticated rate limit | 
| Build times out | Reduce image size or split into multi-stage builds |

Refer to the [Environment Spec](/build-environments/spec) to understand what qualifies as a HUD environment. For further debugging, see [`hud debug`](/reference/cli/debug) for local testing before pushing.
