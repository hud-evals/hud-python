Connect Slack to run agent scenarios without leaving your workspace. Mention `@hud` with a command and get results posted back to the channel.

## Setup

1. Go to [hud.ai/project/settings](https://hud.ai/project/settings)
2. Find the **Integrations** section
3. Click **Add to Slack**
4. Authorize HUD for your workspace

Once connected, you'll see the workspace name and a "Connected" badge.

<Note>
  You need admin or owner permissions on your HUD team to set up integrations.

## Commands

### Run a Scenario

```
@hud run <environment> <scenario> [arg=value ...]
```

Runs an agent on a specific scenario. Arguments with spaces must be quoted.

**Examples:**

```
@hud run browser-env search-task query="best restaurants in SF"
```

```
@hud run code-sandbox debug-task file=main.py line=42
```

```
@hud run ops-diagnostics investigate issue_url="https://sentry.io/issues/12345"
```

The bot reacts with ⏳ while processing, then ✅ on success with a trace link to follow the run.

## Example: Ops Debugging Bot

We use this internally at HUD—when a Sentry alert fires, someone pastes the issue URL into our `#ops` channel:

```
@hud run ops-diagnostics investigate issue_url="https://sentry.io/issues/12345"
```

The agent:
1. Connects to Sentry via MCP
2. Pulls error details, stack traces, and context
3. Analyzes the root cause
4. Posts a summary with suggested fixes

The whole team sees the diagnosis without anyone needing to context-switch into Sentry. We've found it cuts our initial triage time significantly.

<Tip>
  See the [Ops Diagnostics Cookbook](/cookbooks/ops-diagnostics) to set up a similar environment for your team.

### List Available Scenarios

```
@hud list
```

Shows all environments and scenarios you have access to.

### Get Help

```
@hud help
```

Shows available commands and usage examples.

## Options

You can customize runs with additional parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `model` | Model to use (after scenario name) | `claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| `max_steps` | Maximum agent actions | `100` |

**Example with options:**

```
@hud run my-env my-scenario claude-opus-4-5 50 query="hello world"
```

This runs `my-scenario` with `claude-opus-4-5`, max 50 steps, and `query="hello world"`.

## Viewing Results

When you run a scenario, HUD immediately responds with:

- ✅ **Started** confirmation (or ❌ if there's an error)
- **Trace link** — Click to follow the agent's progress live

The trace page shows detailed tool calls, observations, and updates in real-time as the agent runs. Once complete, you'll see the final evaluation result and reward.

## Finding Commands from the Platform

Every scenario card on the platform has a code snippet panel. Click the `</>` icon, then select the **Slack** tab to see the exact command for that scenario with proper argument formatting.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see @hud in my workspace"

Make sure you've completed the OAuth flow in [Settings](https://hud.ai/project/settings). You may need to refresh Slack after authorization.

### "Permission denied" errors

The person running the command needs access to the environment in HUD. Check your team permissions on the platform.

### "Scenario not found"

Double-check the environment and scenario names. Use `@hud list` to see available options.
