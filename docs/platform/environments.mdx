The Environments page at [hud.ai/environments](https://hud.ai/environments) is where you deploy, configure, and monitor your agent environments. Connect a GitHub repo, deploy via CLI, or import a Docker image — then configure environment variables and see live build status.

## Overview

Navigate to **Environments** to see two main tabs:

- **Explore** — Browse public environments from the community
- **My Environments** — Environments you've created or deployed

The header shows real-time stats: environments run in the last 24 hours and currently active instances.

## Creating an Environment

Click **New Environment** to create one. You have three options:

### Import from GitHub

Connect a GitHub repository containing your environment code.

#### Connect GitHub

First, connect your GitHub account by installing the GitHub App:

1. Click **Connect GitHub** to install the HUD GitHub App
2. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the installation
3. Choose repository access:
   - **All repositories** — HUD can build from any repo in your account
   - **Only select repositories** — Grant access to specific repos

</Frame>

<Note>
You can change repository access later in your GitHub settings.
</Note>

#### Build from Repository

Once GitHub is connected:

1. Select a repository from the list
2. Choose a branch (defaults to `main`)
3. Click **Import**

<Frame>
  <img src="/src/images/remote-builds/select-repo.png" alt="Repository selection" />
</Frame>

HUD will clone your repo, build the Docker image, and push it to the HUD registry. Watch build logs in real-time on the Builds tab.

#### Automatic Rebuilds

HUD automatically rebuilds your environment when you push changes to the connected branch. To manually trigger a rebuild, go to the Builds tab and click **Rebuild**.

</Frame>

### Create from Template

Start from a pre-built template:

- **Blank Environment** — Minimal starter for creating custom environments from scratch
- **Deep Research** — Advanced research environment with Exa search integration
- **Rubrics** — Environment for creating and evaluating with rubrics (TLDC methodology)
- **Browser** — Local browser automation environment
- **Remote Browser (Anchor)** — Cloud browser automation with Anchor, Steel, Browserbase, and Kernel providers
- **Coding** — Full-featured coding environment with language servers, linters, and development tools

### Deploy via CLI

For automated pipelines or local deployments, you can deploy directly via CLI:

```bash
hud deploy        # Build remotely & deploy to platform (requires HUD_API_KEY)
```

See [`hud deploy`](/reference/cli/deploy) for details.

### Develop Locally First

The creation page also includes an expandable **Develop an Environment Locally** tutorial that walks through:

1. `hud init` — Create a new environment from a template
2. `hud dev` — Run locally with hot-reload
3. Edit tools in `controller/tools.py` using `@mcp.tool`
4. `hud deploy` — Deploy directly to the platform, or push to GitHub and import for automatic rebuilds

## Environment Details

Click on an environment to see its detail page. The available tabs depend on ownership and registry type:

| Tab | Shown for |
|-----|-----------|
| **Overview** | Always |
| **Scenarios** | Always |
| **Builds** | Owners (GitHub-connected and CLI-deployed) |
| **Files** | Owners with a connected GitHub repository |
| **Settings** | Owners |

<Note>
Public environments viewed by non-owners only show the **Overview** and **Scenarios** tabs.
</Note>

### Overview Tab

The main landing page is a rich detail view with two columns:

**Left side:**
- **Editable description** — Owners can add/edit a description for the environment
- **Info section** — Source (GitHub repo link or "Deployed via CLI"), visibility, build status, branch/commit info, linked evalsets
- **Recent Builds** — Quick summary of the last few builds with status badges
- **Env var warning** — If required environment variables are missing, a warning banner links to Settings
- **Scenarios** — Inline scenario cards showing name, description, and run counts. Click a scenario to select it.
- **Tools** — Horizontal scrollable gallery of tool cards showing name, description, and input schema
- **Integrations** — Code snippets for using the environment via the SDK or CLI

**Right side (sticky panel):**
- **Configure** — Set environment variables and select a scenario to run
- **Scenario Runner** — When a scenario is selected, shows integration options

### Scenarios Tab

Lists all scenarios defined with `@env.scenario()`:

- **Name** — The scenario identifier
- **Description** — What the scenario tests
- **Arguments** — Required parameters

Click a scenario to see its full definition and create tasks from it.

<Frame>
  <img src="/src/images/platform-env-scenarios.png" alt="Scenarios tab showing available scenarios" />
</Frame>

### Builds Tab

Shows build history and status for both GitHub-connected and CLI-deployed environments:

- **Status** — Building, Success, or Failed
- **Duration** — How long the build took
- **Commit** — Git commit that triggered the build (for GitHub builds)
- **Logs** — Click to view full build output

Failed builds show error details to help debug issues.

### Files Tab

Browse the source code of GitHub-connected environments directly in the browser. Shows a file tree and source viewer for the connected repository and branch.

<Note>
The Files tab is only available for environments with a connected GitHub repository.
</Note>

### Settings Tab

Configure your environment:

- **Display Name** — How it appears in the UI
- **Build Settings** — Branch and entry folder
- **Environment Variables** — Secrets and configuration (see below)

## Environment Variables

Many environments need API keys or configuration. Add them in Settings:

1. Go to your environment's **Settings** tab
2. Find the **Environment Variables** section
3. Add key-value pairs for each variable
4. Click **Save**

Variables are encrypted at rest and injected at runtime. They're available in your environment code as regular environment variables.

<Warning>
Never commit secrets to your repository. Always use environment variables for API keys and credentials.
</Warning>

### Lock File Variables

If your environment has a `hud.lock` file defining required variables, Settings will show which ones are missing. You'll see warnings until all required variables are configured.

## Using Environments

Once deployed, use your environment in evaluations:

```python
import hud

# Create a task from a deployed environment
task = hud.Task(
    scenario="my-env/checkout",
    args={"product_name": "Laptop"}
)

async with hud.eval(task) as ctx:
    # Your agent code here
    await ctx.submit(response)
```

Or run from the CLI:

```bash
hud eval my-env/checkout --model gpt-4o --group-size 10
```

## Troubleshooting Builds

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Repository not appearing | Check that you've granted HUD access in GitHub settings |
| Build fails immediately | Verify your Dockerfile exists in the repository root or check the build logs |
| Docker Hub rate limit error | Save your [Docker Hub credentials in settings](https://www.hud.ai/project/secrets) |
| Build times out | Reduce image size or use multi-stage builds |

For local debugging before pushing, see [`hud debug`](/reference/cli/debug).

## Debugging Traces

When viewing a trace (task run), the environment pane on the right side provides powerful debugging tools through two special tabs:

### DEBUG Tab

The DEBUG tab shows low-level information about the environment and agent execution:

- **Environment Info** — Container ID, pod status, and connection details
- **MCP Operations** — All MCP protocol messages including prompts, resources, and internal operations that aren't tool calls
- **Raw Attributes** — Expand any operation to see the full request/response payload
- **Worker Logs** (Admin only) — Server-side logs from the Celery worker that executed the rollout

This is useful for diagnosing:
- Why a scenario setup or evaluation failed
- MCP protocol issues between the agent and environment
- Authentication or connection problems
- Server-side errors that don't surface in the agent trace

### LOGS Tab

The LOGS tab shows container stdout/stderr from the environment:

- **Real-time streaming** — Logs update as the environment runs
- **Timestamp filtering** — See when specific events occurred
- **Error highlighting** — Errors and warnings are visually distinct

This helps debug:
- Environment startup issues
- Tool execution failures
- Python exceptions in your environment code
- Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, disk)

<Tip>
If an agent run fails with no obvious error, check the LOGS tab first—often the environment container logged an exception that explains what went wrong.
</Tip>

### Accessing Debug Information

1. Open any trace at `hud.ai/trace/{id}`
2. Look at the environment pane on the right side
3. Click the **DEBUG** or **LOGS** tab at the top
4. For MCP operations in DEBUG, click the expand icon to see full payloads

<Note>
Worker logs in the DEBUG tab are only visible to platform administrators. Regular users see environment logs in the LOGS tab.
