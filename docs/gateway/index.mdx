HUD Gateway is an OpenAI-compatible inference service that provides a unified endpoint for accessing various LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter). It handles authentication, rate limiting, and credit management, allowing you to focus on building agents.

## Quick Start

The gateway is available at `https://inference.hud.ai`. You can use it with any OpenAI-compatible client.

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
import os

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    base_url="https://inference.hud.ai",
    api_key=os.environ["HUD_API_KEY"]
)

response = await client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://inference.hud.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <HUD_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Supported Models

HUD Gateway supports models from major providers.

### OpenAI
- `gpt-5-2025-08-07`
- `gpt-5.1-2025-11-13`
- `computer-use-preview` (Operator)

### Anthropic
- `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
- `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`
- `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`

### xAI
- `grok-4-1-fast`

### Google

## Features

### Unified Billing
When using HUD Gateway with your HUD API key, usage is automatically deducted from your HUD credits. This simplifies billing by consolidating multiple provider invoices into one.

### Rate Limits
HUD Gateway automatically handles key rotation and rate limiting across our pool of enterprise keys.

## Building Custom Agents with Tracing

For a complete example of building a custom agent that uses HUD Gateway with full tracing support, see the [custom agent example](https://github.com/hud-evals/hud-python/blob/main/examples/05_custom_agent.py).

This example demonstrates:
- Using the `@instrument` decorator to capture inference traces
- Building a custom `MCPAgent` with HUD Gateway
- Automatic token usage and latency tracking
