The `hud rl` command launches GRPO training for a tasks file using the HUD remote service. It converts
local tasks to remote MCP format (building/pushing as needed), walks through model and GPU selection,
then triggers a hosted training job.

## Usage

```bash
hud rl [TASKS_FILE|DATASET] [MODEL] [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments

<ParamField path="tasks_file" type="string">
  Path to tasks JSON/JSONL file or HuggingFace dataset name. If omitted, the CLI attempts to
  auto-detect a tasks file in the current directory.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="model" type="string">
  HUD model name to train (defaults to interactive selection).
</ParamField>

## Options

<ParamField path="--config" type="string">
  Path to an existing configuration file. Short: `-c`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--yes" type="boolean" default="false">
  Auto-accept prompts (non-interactive mode). Short: `-y`
</ParamField>

## Behavior

- Tasks are converted to remote MCP format automatically before training begins.
- The CLI prompts for model selection, GPU type/count, and configuration review. Use `--yes` to accept
  defaults without prompts.
- The resulting job appears in the HUD dashboard, and vLLM is deployed automatically if not already
  running for the model.

## Examples

```bash
# Launch remote training (defaults to interactive model selection)
hud rl tasks.json --model claude-rl

# Launch using a dataset
hud rl hud-evals/SheetBench-50 --model claude-rl

# Run non-interactively with defaults
hud rl tasks.json --model claude-rl --yes
```
