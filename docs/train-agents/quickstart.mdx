## Quickstart

Install and download a taskset:

```bash
uv tool install hud-python
hud get hud-evals/basic-2048
```

### 1) Simple: Train (remote by default)

```bash
hud rl basic-2048.json
```

This launches training remotely and automatically provisions a vLLM server and a trainer for you. You can monitor progress on https://hud.so. The server persists between runs, so you can rerun training or evaluate against the same endpoint.

Optional baseline first (Claude or Operator):

```bash
hud eval basic-2048.json
```

### 2) Run on your own machine/remote

Use any provider with at least 2 GPUs (one for inference, one for training). Run locally with the flag `--local`:

```bash
uv tool install hud-python
hud get hud-evals/basic-2048
hud rl basic-2048.json --local
```

### Recommended setups

- 2× A100: quick iteration, shorter runs
- 8× A100: higher throughput for larger tasksets

Training throughput depends on task complexity and parallelism (`max_parallel_episodes`).

### 3) Build your own environment (hud init)

Create a new MCP environment, develop with hot-reload, and train on a production image:

```bash
hud init my-env && cd my-env
hud dev --interactive
# When ready to run:
hud rl
```

Change the tasks.json to include other tasks you want to train on.

See [hud init](/reference/cli/init) for options and details.
