You've built an environment with tools and scenarios. Deploy it to the platform and you can run evals at scale—hundreds of parallel runs across models, all traced, all generating training data.

## hud deploy

The simplest path. One command builds and deploys your environment directly to HUD:

```bash
hud deploy
```

This:
1. Packages your build context (respects `.dockerignore`)
2. Uploads to HUD's build service
3. Builds remotely via AWS CodeBuild
4. Streams logs in real-time
5. Links this directory to the deployed environment

Once complete, your environment appears on the platform:

<Frame>
  <img src="/src/images/platform-environments.png" alt="Deployed environment on the platform" />
</Frame>

See your environment's tools, scenarios, and builds at [hud.ai/environments](https://hud.ai/environments). For full details on managing environments through the platform UI, see [Platform Environments](/platform/environments).

### Rebuilding

Run `hud deploy` again in the same directory. HUD reads `.hud/deploy.json` to find your existing environment and builds a new version:

```bash
hud deploy  # v0.1.0
# make changes...
hud deploy  # v0.1.1
```

### Configuration

<Accordion title="Environment Variables">
Variables from your `.env` file are automatically passed during deployment. Override or use a different file:

```bash
hud deploy -e API_KEY=secret -e DEBUG=true    # Inline overrides
hud deploy --env-file .env.production         # Different env file
```

Variables are encrypted at rest and injected at runtime.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Naming">
Environment name is determined by (in order): `--name` flag, `[tool.hud].name` in pyproject.toml, or the directory name.

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.hud]
name = "My Browser Environment"
```
</Accordion>

## GitHub Auto-Deploy

For teams and CI/CD, connect a GitHub repository. HUD rebuilds automatically when you push:

1. Go to [hud.ai](https://hud.ai) → **New** → **Environment**
2. Click **Connect GitHub** and install the HUD GitHub App
3. Select your repository and branch
4. Push changes—rebuilds happen automatically

<Frame>
  <img src="/src/images/remote-builds/select-repo.png" alt="Connecting a GitHub repository" />
</Frame>

This is better for long-term projects because:
- **CI/CD integration**: Rebuilds on every push to your branch
- **Team collaboration**: Anyone with repo access can trigger deploys
- **Version history**: See which commit each build came from
- **Rollback**: Deploy previous commits if needed

### Switching Between Methods

Started with `hud deploy` but want GitHub integration later? Just connect the same repo on the platform. HUD links them by environment ID.

Going the other way? Use `hud link` to connect a local directory to an existing platform environment:

```bash
hud link --id existing-environment-id
```

## Comparison

| Feature | `hud deploy` | GitHub Integration |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Setup | One command | Connect repo on platform |
| Rebuilds | Manual (`hud deploy`) | Automatic on push |
| Best for | Solo dev, quick iteration | Teams, CI/CD |
| Env vars | `.env` file (automatic) | Platform settings |

Both methods result in the same deployed environment. Choose based on your workflow.
